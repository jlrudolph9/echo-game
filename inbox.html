                <p class="email-body">Echo,</p>
                <p class="email-body">I don’t even know where to start. I’ve been replaying that night over and over in my mind, and I can’t believe what I’ve done. I was angry, and I let that anger take control. You broke up with me, and I couldn't handle it.</p>
                <p class="email-body">I shouldn't have kept that spare key to your apartment, but I did. That night, I used it. I came to your place thinking I could talk to you, make you understand, but it all went wrong. You were scared, and I didn’t know how to calm you down. Everything spiraled out of control so fast.</p>
                <p class="email-body">You were screaming, and I... I lost it. I didn’t mean to hurt you, Echo, I swear. But then, someone else came along and... finished the job. I didn’t want it to go that far. I’m so sorry. I wish I could take it all back.</p>
                <p class="email-body">Tristan</p>

                <p class="email-body">Echo,</p>
                <p class="email-body">It seems you’ve been avoiding me ever since you took on the report about The Silencer. You know how badly I wanted that story, but you just had to swoop in and take it from me, didn’t you? I guess the best reporter always wins, right?</p>
                <p class="email-body">Funny thing is, I’ve been hearing some interesting rumors around the office. People saying you’ve been receiving some rather threatening notes. I wonder who could be behind that? Maybe you’re getting too close to something dangerous. Maybe you should have left well enough alone.</p>
                <p class="email-body">That night... you remember, don’t you? You had to push it, had to dig deeper. Tristan was an angry fool, but useful. He had the keys, and I had the resolve. You should have stayed out of my business, Echo. You should have stayed away from The Silencer.</p>
                <p class="email-body">Yes, Echo, I am The Silencer. And now, you’ll never be able to reveal the truth. Consider yourself silenced, forever.</p>
