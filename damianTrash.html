            Hi Damian,
        </p>

        <p class="silencerReport">
            I hope you're doing well. I wanted to reach out to apologize for being assigned the report on The Silencer. I know how much you wanted this assignment and how important it is to you, and I genuinely feel bad that it ended up in my lap. It wasn't my decision, and I hope you can understand that.
        </p>

        <p class="silencerReport">
            I've also been receiving your texts, and I must admit, they are quite concerning. I understand you're upset, but the tone and content of your messages have been troubling. I really value our working relationship and want us to continue to work together effectively and safely. Please, let's find a way to discuss this matter constructively.
        </p>

        <p class="silencerReport">
            Again, I'm sorry for how things turned out with the assignment. Let's find a way to move past this.
        </p>

        <p class="silencerReport">
            Best,
        </p>
